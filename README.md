ðŸ§© Technologies Used

JavaScript (ES6) â€“ Form validation logic

The user fills out the form fields.

JavaScript listens for input events and validates each field in real time.

If any field fails validation, an error message is displayed immediately.

The form can only be submitted when all inputs are valid.
